          I help who I can, anytime I can. My friends are few. They would say I
          am a homebody. They would also say I am amiable and fun in social
          situation. My family knows I am always there; when they need or want
          me. My coworkers can count on me.

          I want to improve the world. My family is my priority. I enjoy
          politics and religion, or the study of how. The work I do allows me to
          help build our world. I hold the freedom to learn very highly. Long
          sandy beaches make me smile.
