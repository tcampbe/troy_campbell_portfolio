          As a kid, I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. 
          I have had many positions in life, and am proud of them all. 
          Especially the roles of husband, father, brother and son.
          My heroes were my maternal grandfather, who served in the 
          south pacific during WWII and my father, who served in 
          Viet Nam and then as a firefighter at home. 
          So, I have always wanted to serve my fellow man. 
        </p>
        <p class="militaryMedical">
          I served in the USAR (https://www.usar.army.mil/) for 8 years. 
          I have worked as an LVN, a massage therapist, 
          a dieticianâ€™s assistant 
          (https://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/career-match/science-medicine/physical-mental-health/68m-nutrition-care-specialist.html), 
          and a lab accessioner for a combined 15 years of medical 
          experience including training at Fort Sam Houston, 
          South Plains College, and Austin School of Massage Therapy.
