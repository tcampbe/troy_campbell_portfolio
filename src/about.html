                    As a kid, I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. 
                    However, I have held many positions in life, and am proud of them all. 
                    Especially the roles of husband, father, brother and son.
                    My heroes were my maternal grandfather, who served in the 
                    south pacific during WWII and my father, who served in 
                    Viet Nam and then as a firefighter in Texas. 
                    So, I have always wanted to serve my fellow man.

            I have discovered the work I want to do, 
            and it is true what they say. 
            If you find work you love, you never work again. 
            My current employment is in application 
            administration along with database support 
            moving toward software and web development. 
            Daily using SQL in SSMS and Oracle,
