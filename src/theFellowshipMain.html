        Our Beliefs
      </h2>
      <p class="beliefs">
        We are Christian by faith and Southern Baptist by denomination.
        You become a Southern Baptist by uniting with a 
        Southern Baptist church, one in friendly cooperation with the 
        general Southern Baptist enterprise of reaching the world for 
        Christ. Typically church membership is a matter of receiving 
        Jesus as your Savior and Lord and experiencing believer's 
        baptism by immersion.
        Southern Baptists have prepared a statement of generally held 
        convictions called The Baptist Faith and Message. It serves 
        as a guide to understanding who they are. Copies are 
        available at Southern Baptist churches. The topics here 
        provide only a brief, partial summary.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The Scriptures
      </h2>
      <p class="scriptures">
        The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is 
        God's revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of 
        divine instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for 
        its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its 
        matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true and 
        trustworthy. It reveals the principles by which God judges us, 
        and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world 
        the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard 
        by which all human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions 
        should be tried. All Scripture is a testimony to Christ, 
        who is Himself the focus of divine revelation.
      </p>
     
      <h2>
        God
      </h2>
      <p class="god">
        There is one and only one living and true God.
         …The eternal triune God reveals Himself to us as Father, 
         Son and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, 
         but without division of nature, essence, or being.
      </p>

      <h2>
        God the Father
      </h2>
      <p class="father">
        God as Father reigns with providential care over His universe, 
        His creatures, and the flow of the stream of human history 
        according to the purposes of His grace. …God is Father in 
        truth to those who become children of God through faith 
        in Jesus Christ.
      </p>

      <h2>
        God the Son
      </h2>
      <p class="son">
        Christ is the eternal Son of God. In His incarnation 
        as Jesus Christ, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit 
        and born of the virgin Mary. …He honored the divine law 
        by His personal obedience, and in His substitutionary death 
        on the cross, He made provision for the redemption of men 
        from sin.
      </p>

      <h2>
        God the Holy Spirit
      </h2>
      <p class="spirit">
        The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, fully divine.
        …He exalts Christ. He convicts men of sin, of righteousness 
        and of judgment. …He enlightens and empowers the believer 
        and the church in worship, evangelism, and service.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Man
      </h2>
      <p class="man">
        Man is the special creation of God, in His own image. 
        He created them male and female as the crowning work of 
        His creation. …By his free choice man sinned against God 
        and brought sin into the human race. … The sacredness of 
        human personality is evident in that God created man in 
        His own image, and in that Christ died for man; therefore 
        every person of every race possesses dignity and is worthy 
        of respect and Christian love.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Salvation
      </h2>
      <p class="salvation">
        Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, 
        and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ 
        as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood obtained 
        eternal redemption for the believer. In its broadest 
        sense salvation includes regeneration, justification, 
        sanctification, and glorification.
      </p>

      <h2>
        God's Purpose of Grace
      </h2>
      <p class="grace">
        Election is the gracious purpose of God, according to 
        which He regenerates, justifies, sanctifies, and glorifies 
        sinners. …All true believers endure to the end. 
        Those whom God has accepted in Christ, and sanctified 
        by His Spirit will never fall away from the state of grace, 
        but shall persevere to the end.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        The Church
      </h2>
      <p class="church">
        A New Testament church of the Lord Jesus Christ is 
        an autonomous local congregation of baptized believers, 
        associated by covenant in the faith and fellowship 
        of the gospel, observing the two ordinances of Christ, 
        governed by His laws, exercising the gifts, rights, 
        and privileges invested in them by His Word, 
        and seeking to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth. 
        Each congregation operates under the Lordship of Christ 
        through democratic processes. In such a congregation 
        each member is responsible and accountable to Christ as Lord. 
        Its scriptural officers are pastors and deacons. 
        While both men and women are gifted for service in the church, 
        the office of pastor is limited to men as qualified 
        by Scripture.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Baptism
      </h2>
      <p class="baptism">
        Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water. 
        …It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's 
        faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, 
        the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, 
        and the resurrection to walk in newness of life 
        in Christ Jesus.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The Lord's Supper
      </h2>
      <p class="supper">
        The Lord's Supper is a symbolic act of obedience 
        whereby members … memorialize the death of the Redeemer 
        and anticipate His second coming.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Evangelism & Missions
      </h2>
      <p class="evangelism">
        It is the duty and privelege of every follower 
        of Christ and every church of the Lord Jesus Christ 
        to endeavor to make disciples of all nations... 
        to seek constantly to win the lost to Christ 
        by verbal witness undergirded by a Christian lifestyle, 
        and by other methods in harmony with the gospel of Christ.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The Lord's Day
      </h2>
      <p class="sunday">
        The first day of the week is the Lord's Day. 
        …It commemorates the resurrection of Christ from 
        the dead and should be employed in exercises 
        of worship and spiritual devotion.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Last Things
      </h2>
      <p class="last">
        God, in His own time and in His own way, 
        will bring the world to its appropriate end. 
        …Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly
        …the dead will be raised; and Christ will judge 
        all men in righteousness. The unrighteous will 
        be consigned to Hell. …The righteous… will receive 
        their reward and will dwell forever in Heaven 
        with the Lord.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Education
      </h2>
      <p class="education">
        The cause of education in the Kingdom of Christ is 
        co-ordinate with the causes of missions and general 
        benevolence … there should be a proper balance between 
        academic freedom and academic responsibility. 
        …The freedom of a teacher in a Christian school, 
        college, or seminary is limited by the pre-eminence 
        of Jesus Christ, by the authoritative nature 
        of the Scriptures, and by the distinct purpose 
        for which the school exists.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Stewardship
      </h2>
      <p class="stewardship">
        God is the source of all blessings, temporal and spiritual; 
        all that we have and are we owe to Him. 
        Christians have a spiritual debtorship to the whole world, 
        a holy trusteeship in the gospel, and a binding stewardship 
        in their possessions. They are therefore under obligation 
        to serve Him with their time, talents, 
        and material possessions.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Cooperation
      </h2>
      <p class="cooperation">
        Christ's people should … organize such associations 
        and conventions as may best secure cooperation 
        for the great objects of the Kingdom of God. 
        Such organizations have no authority over one 
        another or over the churches. …Cooperation 
        is desirable between the various Christian denominations.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The Christian & the Social Order
      </h2>
      <p class="social">
        All Christians are under obligation to seek to 
        make the will of Christ supreme in our own lives 
        and in human society... in the spirit of Christ, 
        Christians should oppose racism, every form of greed, 
        selfishness, and vice, and all forms of sexual immorality, 
        including adultery, homosexuality, and pornography. 
        We should work to provide for the orphaned, the needy, 
        the abused, the aged, the helpless, and the sick. 
        We should speak on behalf of the unborn and contend 
        for the sanctity of all human life from conception 
        to natural death...
      </p>

      <h2>
        Religious Liberty
      </h2>
      <p class="liberty">
        Church and state should be separate. The state owes to 
        every church protection and full freedom in the pursuit 
        of its spiritual ends. …A free church in a free state 
        is the Christian ideal.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Family
      </h2>
      <p class="family">
        God has ordained the family as the foundational 
        institution of human society. It is composed of 
        persons related to one another by marriage, 
        blood or adoption.

        Marriage is the uniting of one man and one 
        woman in covenant commitment for a lifetime. 
        ... The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, 
        since both are created in God's image. A husband is 
        to love his wife as Christ loved the church. 
        He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, 
        to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to 
        submit herself graciously to the servant leadership 
        of her husband even as the church willingly submits 
        to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image 
        of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, 
        has the God-given responsibility to respect her 
        husband and to serve as his helper in managing 
        the household and nurturing the next generation... 
        Children, from the moment of conception, are a 
        blessing and heritage from the Lord. Parents are 
        to demonstrate to their children God's pattern 
        for marriage.
      </p>
